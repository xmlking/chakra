# Email SDK

Use this skill when an agent works with this repository or wires `@opencoredev/email-sdk` into another TypeScript app.

This skill is intentionally dynamic: do not treat the examples below as the full current API. First refresh the local package docs/source for the installed version, then implement against what the repo or dependency actually exposes.

## Refresh Current Docs

Before changing code, inspect the most relevant current sources:

1. If you are inside this repo, read:
   - `README.md`
   - `packages/email-sdk/README.md`
   - `packages/email-sdk/package.json`
   - `apps/fumadocs/content/docs/**/*.mdx`
   - `packages/email-sdk/src/index.ts`
   - the specific adapter file in `packages/email-sdk/src/<adapter>.ts`
   - `packages/email-sdk/src/types.ts`, `core.ts`, and `errors.ts` when message shape, routing, retries, hooks, or error handling matter.
2. If you are inside an app that has `@opencoredev/email-sdk` installed, inspect:
   - the app lockfile and `node_modules/@opencoredev/email-sdk/package.json`
   - `node_modules/@opencoredev/email-sdk/README.md`
   - `node_modules/@opencoredev/email-sdk/dist/*.d.ts`
   - the app's existing email, notification, queue, environment, and test patterns.
3. If local docs are missing or the task depends on version-sensitive behavior, fetch the current published package metadata/docs before implementing:
   - `bun pm view @opencoredev/email-sdk`
   - `bun email-sdk version` when the CLI is installed in the target app
   - `bunx --yes jsr info email-sdk` only if the project is using JSR
   - the repository docs or package README for the exact version in use.

When local source and external docs disagree, prefer the code/types for the exact installed version and mention the mismatch.

## Defaults

- Prefer `bun` and `bunx`.
- Keep the core dependency-free.
- Import adapters from separate entry points such as `@opencoredev/email-sdk/resend`, `@opencoredev/email-sdk/smtp`, and the adapter-specific entry point shown by the current package exports.
- Do not add Nodemailer for SMTP; Email SDK includes its own SMTP transport.
- SMTP auth on non-secure ports upgrades with STARTTLS by default. Only use `allowInsecureAuth` for trusted local test servers.
- Adapters must either map a normalized `EmailMessage` field or reject it clearly. Never silently drop CC, BCC, reply-to, headers, tags, metadata, or attachments.
- Keep adapter credentials in environment variables.
- Never log API keys, SMTP passwords, raw tokens, full message bodies, or unnecessary recipient data.
- Preserve the host app's architecture for queues, templates, env validation, retries, and tests.

## Integration Pattern

Entry point names like `@opencoredev/email-sdk/resend` and `@opencoredev/email-sdk/smtp` are illustrative. Verify the exact exports from the installed version before copying these imports.

Prefer wiring Email SDK as a production send pipeline: one normalized message shape, explicit adapter routes, fail-fast field support, retries, compatible fallback routes, secret-safe observability, tests, and CLI verification.

```ts
import { createEmailClient } from "@opencoredev/email-sdk";
import { resend } from "@opencoredev/email-sdk/resend";
import { smtp } from "@opencoredev/email-sdk/smtp";

export const email = createEmailClient({
  adapters: [
    resend({ apiKey: process.env.RESEND_API_KEY! }),
    smtp({
      host: process.env.SMTP_HOST!,
      port: Number(process.env.SMTP_PORT ?? 587),
      auth: {
        user: process.env.SMTP_USER!,
        pass: process.env.SMTP_PASS!,
      },
    }),
  ],
  fallback: ["smtp"],
  retry: { retries: 1 },
});
```

## Fallback and retry guidance

- Choose fallback routes only after checking the current field support docs or adapter source.
- Use fallback only when the backup adapter can send the same class of email and preserve the fields that matter to the app.
- Do not treat SMTP as a universal backup; it is best for simple text/html sends with address fields and headers.
- Use idempotency keys for externally visible transactional sends that may be retried or sent through fallback routes.
- Use hooks or `observabilityPlugin()` for redacted route, attempt, retry, success, and error events.
- Add tests with `memoryProvider()`, `failingProvider()`, and `capturePlugin()` when fallback or retry behavior matters.
- Use the CLI `doctor` and `--dry-run` before live provider smoke tests.

Inside this repo, the main public docs for this pattern are:

- `apps/fumadocs/content/docs/guides/production-send-pipeline.mdx`
- `apps/fumadocs/content/docs/concepts/fallbacks-and-retries.mdx`
- `apps/fumadocs/content/docs/adapters/field-support.mdx`

## Validation

- For SDK changes, run `bun test` in `packages/email-sdk`.
- For docs changes, run `bun run check-types` and `bun run build` from the repo root when practical.
- For app integrations, run the narrowest test/typecheck that covers the send path.
- For real provider smoke tests, use the CLI with explicit test recipients and do not send external mail without the user's approval.

## Review Checklist

- Does every send include `from`, `to`, `subject`, and either `html` or `text`?
- Are fallbacks configured only for adapters that can send the same class of email?
- Are idempotency keys used for externally visible transactional sends?
- Are provider errors surfaced instead of swallowed?
- Are hooks used for metadata and status, not secret or full-body logging?
- Does each adapter payload have a test when its field mapping changes?
