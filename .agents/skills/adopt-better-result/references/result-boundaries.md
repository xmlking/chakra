# Result boundaries and codecs

## Decide where Result ends

Use `Result<T, E>` for in-process recoverable control flow. Plain in-process calls do not need serialization.

Use `Result.codec` whenever a `Result` is serialized across a boundary or received from untrusted data, including:

- HTTP and RPC
- server actions
- queues and event payloads
- workers and cross-process messages
- persistence or caches that store Result envelopes

Filesystem, database, subprocess, HTTP-client, and SDK calls are also failure-producing boundaries. Wrap their known operational failures in specific tagged errors even when no Result envelope crosses them.

## Define an explicit wire contract

Create one named codec for each boundary contract. Pass four named directional schemas to `Result.codec`; define their validation and mapping outside the codec declaration. Those Standard Schema-compatible schemas must:

- serialize both success and error payloads
- validate the outer Result envelope and selected payload
- expose stable wire tags/codes and safe fields
- transform dates, classes, and other non-JSON runtime values explicitly
- reconstruct domain values and tagged errors when deserializing into trusted code
- reject unknown or malformed payloads rather than asserting their types

Expose only stable public codes and safe fields in public wire errors. Define an explicit public contract with dedicated schemas.

```ts
const CustomerResultCodec = Result.codec({
  serialize: {
    ok: CustomerToWireSchema,
    err: CustomerErrorToWireSchema,
  },
  deserialize: {
    ok: CustomerFromWireSchema,
    err: CustomerErrorFromWireSchema,
  },
});
```

Verify exact APIs against the installed version. Codec serialization can return `ResultSerializationError`; deserialization can return `ResultDeserializationError`. Add both to the boundary's handling design. When the application owns both producer and consumer, versions their schemas together, and treats contract mismatch as a defect, prefer `serializeUnsafe` and `deserializeUnsafe` to remove the codec-error handling and translation layer. `serializeUnsafe` panics instead of returning `ResultSerializationError`; `deserializeUnsafe` panics only on `ResultDeserializationError` and preserves valid decoded domain Err values. Keep the safe methods for public, independently versioned, persisted, or otherwise untrusted boundaries. Schema implementations that throw or reject are defects and surface as `Panic`.

## Audit both sides

For each boundary, identify the producer and every consumer. Confirm they agree on:

- envelope shape and versioning
- error discriminants and safe metadata
- sync or async codec behavior
- malformed-payload behavior
- retry and idempotency expectations
- user-facing status/message mapping

Test successful and failed round trips, each error variant, malformed envelopes, malformed payloads, and removal of sensitive fields.
